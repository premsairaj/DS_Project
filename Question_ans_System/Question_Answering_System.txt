Step1:
       We have to Create a Dataset in 'Json' format
       refer:https://simpletransformers.ai/docs/qa-data-formats/

       in the Json File We have dictionaries of Keys
       context: The paragraph or text from which the question is asked.
       qas: A list of questions and answers (format below).
       
       Questions and answers are represented as dictionaries. Each dictionary in 'qas' has the following format.

       id: (string) A unique ID for the question. Should be unique across the entire dataset.
       question: (string) A question.
       is_impossible: (bool) Indicates whether the question can be answered correctly from the context.
       answers: (list) The list of correct answers to the question.
       A single answer is represented by a dictionary with the following attributes.

       text: (string) The answer to the question. Must be a substring of the context.
       answer_start: (int) Starting index of the answer in the context

Step2:
      Divide the Dataset into Train and evaluate ,test
Step3:!pip install simpletransformers #if we want to do the quick training and evalution then we use simpletransformers
Step4:import logging
      from simpletransformers.question_answering import QuestionAnsweringModel, QuestionAnsweringArgs

      QuestionAnsweringModel--->it is the model it required 3 things  i)model_type ii)model_name iii)model_args
      QuestionAnsweringArgs---->it is used to set configuration of the model like(epochs,batch_size...)
      
     Ex:model_type='bert'
        model_name='bert-base-cased'
Step5:Create a Model
      model = QuestionAnsweringModel(model_type,model_name, args=model_args)

      for training the model use 'model.train_model(train,eval_data=test)'
      for evaluting the model use 'result, texts = model.eval_model(test)'
